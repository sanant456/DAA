# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element 
from the unsorted portion of the array and places it in its correct position in the sorted portion.



 ## Algorithm (Step-by-Step):-
 
	
  1.	Start from the first element and assume it is the minimum.
  2.	Scan the rest of the array to find the smallest element.
  3.	Swap the smallest element with the first element.
  4.	Move to the next position and repeat until the entire array is sorted.



## Time Complexity:-


•	Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n^2)
•	Worst & Average Case: O(n^2)
•	Space Complexity: O(1) (In-place sorting)
