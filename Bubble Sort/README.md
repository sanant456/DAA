  # Bubble Sort

  Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This      process is repeated until the array is fully sorted.

  ### Algorithm (Step-by-Step):-

  1.	Start from the first element and compare it with the next element.
  2.	If the current element is greater, swap them.
  3.	Move to the next pair and repeat step 2.
  4.	Continue until the largest element is at the last position.
  5.	Repeat the process for the remaining elements until the whole array is sorted.


  ### Time Complexity:-
  
  •	Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)
	•	Worst & Average Case: O(n^2)
