# Insertion Sort:-

Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time. 
It works by picking an element and inserting it into its correct position within the sorted part of the array.



### Algorithm (Step-by-Step):-
	
1.	Assume the first element is already sorted.
2.	Pick the next element and compare it with the elements in the sorted section.
3.	Shift larger elements one position to the right.
4.	Insert the picked element in its correct position.
5.	Repeat until the entire array is sorted.



### Time Complexity:-

  •	Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)
  •	Worst & Average Case: O(n^2)
  •	Space Complexity: O(1) (In-place sorting)
